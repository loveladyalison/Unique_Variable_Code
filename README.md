This was my first attempt using Visual Studio Code with Python. 
I am working through Zed A. Shaw's "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifying Beautiful World of Computers and Code" 
I follow @bigdataqueen on TikTok; this was one of three textbook's that she suggested. It has been a great aid so far!
